RELEASE NOTES v0.8.8


The admission control request structure is too large for the kernel stack.
Such a structure should either be allocated using vmalloc() or globally for a
module.

No marshalling-unmarshalling is performed when using the front-end to use
admission control over the network. Users should beware not to use this version
on machines with different bytecode or different number sizes.
